# Final Project
###### Drawing on the Web | Spring 2017


Recently I’ve gone back to an old hobby, photography. I forgot that it was something I used to love until I met a photographer this semester. When they first let me play with their camera, I had a moment of nostalgia that rekindled my interest in photography. So for my final project, I decided that the theme for my three web drawings would be photography and since I am graduating, I decided to include images about “Eats”, “Places” and “People” over the past four years of my life. 

Each of these drawings will contain a layering and overlapping of images to visually show the relation of these images to the main subject (Eat, Places, or People), as well as represent the connection I have to subject of these images (memories, relationships, etc). Aesthetically, the three drawings are very similar; they all follow the same design. All the drawings are displayed in black and white to portray them as memories, moments of the past. But when users hover over the images, the images will gradually change from black and white to color. Additionally, the drawings contain audio and a full screen background video of simple patterns and motions. This project utilizes sound, motion and visual changes to recreate and revisit the memories.

These browser drawings are focused around the photos and meant to be designed like a virtual scrapbook, so each of the drawings contain animations that are designed to be like the decorations in a physical scrapbook. All of these animations are created by using CSS animations combined with CSS shapes or SVG. For the final scrapbook aspect, the project uses jQuery UI to allow for the display of image captions.
